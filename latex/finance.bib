abstract = "This paper presents a comprehensive review of the work done, during the 1968–2005, in the application of statistical and intelligent techniques to solve the bankruptcy prediction problem faced by banks and firms. The review is categorized by taking the type of technique applied to solve this problem as an important dimension. Accordingly, the papers are grouped in the following families of techniques: (i) statistical techniques, (ii) neural networks, (iii) case-based reasoning, (iv) decision trees, (iv) operational research, (v) evolutionary approaches, (vi) rough set based techniques, (vii) other techniques subsuming fuzzy logic, support vector machine and isotonic separation and (viii) soft computing subsuming seamless hybridization of all the above-mentioned techniques. Of particular significance is that in each paper, the review highlights the source of data sets, financial ratios used, country of origin, time line of study and the comparative performance of techniques in terms of prediction accuracy wherever available. The review also lists some important directions for future research."

abstract = "In this paper, we compare some traditional statistical methods for predicting financial distress to some more “unconventional” methods, such as decision tree classification, neural networks, and evolutionary computation techniques, using data collected from 200 Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TSEC) listed companies. Empirical experiments were conducted using a total of 42 ratios including 33 financial, 8 non-financial and 1 combined macroeconomic index, using principle component analysis (PCA) to extract suitable variables. This paper makes four critical contributions: (1) with nearly 80  fewer financial ratios by the PCA method, the prediction performance is still able to provide highly-accurate forecasts of financial bankruptcy; (2) we show that traditional statistical methods are better able to handle large datasets without sacrificing prediction performance, while intelligent techniques achieve better performance with smaller datasets and would be adversely affected by huge datasets; (3) empirical results show that C5.0 and CART provide the best prediction performance for imminent bankruptcies; and (4) Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with evolutionary computation provide a good balance of high-accuracy short- and long-term performance predictions for healthy and distressed firms. Therefore, the experimental results show that the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) integrated with SVM (PSO–SVM) approach could be considered for predicting potential financial distress."

This study investigates the usefulness of Decision Trees, Neural Networks and Bayesian Belief Networks in the identification of fraudulent financial statements. The input vector is composed of ratios derived from financial statements. The three models are compared in terms of their performances."

This paper presents a multi-industry investigation of the bankruptcy of Korean companies using back-propagation neural network (BNN). The industries include construction, retail, and manufacturing. The study intends to suggest the industry specific model to predict bankruptcy by selecting appropriate independent variables. The prediction accuracy of BNN is compared to that of multivariate discriminant analysis. The results indicate that prediction using industry sample outperforms the prediction using the entire sample which is not classified according to industry by 6–12"

abstract = "This paper proposes a hybrid method for effective bankruptcy prediction, based on the combination of variable selection using decision trees and case-based reasoning using the Mahalanobis distance with variable weight. Unlike the existing case-based reasoning methods using the Euclidean distance, we introduce the Mahalanobis distance in locating the nearest neighbors, which considers the covariance structure of variables in measuring the closeness. Since hundreds of financial ratio variables are available in analyzing credit management problems, the model performance is also affected by input variable selection strategies. Variables selected by the decision trees induction tend to have an interaction compared to those produced by the regression approaches. The Mahalanobis distance is a more true measure of proximity than the Euclidean distance when variables are correlated with each other. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms some currently-in-use techniques."

Many statistical and intelligent methods have been proposed, however, there is no overall best method has been used in predicting corporate bankruptcy. Recent studies suggest ensemble learning methods may have potential applicability in corporate bankruptcy prediction. In this paper, a new and improved Boosting, FS-Boosting, is proposed to predict corporate bankruptcy. Through injecting feature selection strategy into Boosting, FS-Booting can get better performance as base learners in FS-Boosting could get more accuracy and diversity. For the testing and illustration purposes, two real world bankruptcy datasets were selected to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of FS-Boosting. Experimental results reveal that FS-Boosting could be used as an alternative method for the corporate bankruptcy prediction."

This rule can be used as a benchmark to improve targeting in order to reach the stated policy goals. Public guarantee schemes should target firms that are both financially constrained and creditworthy, but they often employ naïve assignment rules (mostly based only on the probability of default) that may lead to an inefficient allocation of resources. Examining the case of Italy’s Guarantee Fund, we suggest a benchmark ML-based assignment rule, trained and tested on credit register data. Compared with the current eligibility criteria, the ML-based benchmark leads to a significant improvement in the effectiveness of the Fund in gaining credit access to firms. We discuss the problems in estimating and using these algorithms for the actual implementation of public policies, such as transparency and omitted payoffs.},
